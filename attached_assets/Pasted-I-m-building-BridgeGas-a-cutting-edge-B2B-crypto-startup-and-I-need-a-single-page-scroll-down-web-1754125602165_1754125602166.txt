I’m building BridgeGas, a cutting-edge B2B crypto startup, and I need a single-page, scroll-down website in English that captures interested companies’ contact info (for a whitelist), presents who we are, what we offer, and introduces our founding team. Below are the full requirements:

1. General Style & Branding
Color Palette: Luxurious, deep, trust-evoking tones (e.g. charcoal black, midnight blue, dark slate).

Typography: Clean, professional sans-serif headings (e.g. Montserrat, Poppins) and a neutral body font (e.g. Roboto, Open Sans).

Logo Placement: Top-center or top-left in the hero section (I will supply the SVG/PNG).

Overall Look & Feel: High-end, minimalist, plenty of whitespace, subtle animations (fade/slide on scroll), consistent button styles.

2. Page Structure & Content
Hero Section

Logo + Project Name: “BridgeGas” prominently displayed.

Tagline: One short sentence that sums up our mission (e.g. “Bridging TradFi & Crypto Payment Solutions”).

Background: A dark, subtle gradient or abstract blockchain-themed graphic.
